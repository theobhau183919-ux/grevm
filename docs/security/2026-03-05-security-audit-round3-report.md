## HIGH Severity (2)

### GREVM-R3-001: TOCTOU in `async_finality` — Lock-Drop-Reacquire Still Exploitable

**File:** `grevm/src/scheduler.rs:355-374`

The `async_finality` loop acquires the lock at line 358 to check `status == Unconfirmed`, then **drops the lock** (temporary `MutexGuard`). It performs timestamp checks (lines 361-371) without holding any lock, then **re-acquires** at line 372 and unconditionally sets `Finality`.

The Round 1 reviewer (GREVM-004) stated logical timestamps prevent exploitation. However, the `lower_ts` mechanism has a gap: `reset_validation_idx(txid+1)` sets `lower_ts[txid+1]`, NOT `lower_ts[txid]`. So for `finality_idx = txid`, the timestamp guard does not fire for conflicts detected AT that txid.

**Race sequence:**
1. Finality thread: reads `Unconfirmed` at line 358, drops lock
2. Worker: validates tx, finds conflict, sets `Conflict`, calls `reset_validation_idx(txid+1)` — updates `lower_ts[txid+1]`
3. Finality thread: checks `lower_ts[txid]` (unchanged!), passes, re-acquires lock, overwrites to `Finality`

**Impact:** Transaction committed as final with stale execution results — consensus-breaking state corruption.

**Fix:** Re-check status after re-acquiring the lock:
```rust
let mut tx_state = self.tx_states[finality_idx].lock();
if tx_state.status != TransactionStatus::Unconfirmed {
    break;
}
tx_state.status = TransactionStatus::Finality;
```

**Prior:** GREVM-004 (Round 1). **Still exploitable.**

### GREVM-R3-002: CommitGuard Does Not Prevent Simultaneous Mutable Aliases

**File:** `grevm/src/async_commit.rs:13-27`, `scheduler.rs:456,580`

`CommitGuard::new()` takes `&UnsafeCell<ParallelState<DB>>` (shared ref). Two `CommitGuard` instances can coexist — one at line 456 (`parallel_execute`) and one at line 580 (`fallback_sequential`). While the current code ensures temporal separation (scope joins before fallback), the type system provides no enforcement.

Additionally, `state_ref()` (line 68-71) creates `&ParallelState` while `state_mut()` creates `&mut ParallelState` from the same `UnsafeCell`, within the same `commit()` method — technically UB under Rust's aliasing rules even though the references don't overlap temporally within the method.

**Impact:** The CommitGuard pattern fails to provide the compile-time safety GREVM-R2-001 was designed to deliver. Future refactors could silently introduce UB.

**Prior:** GREVM-R2-001 (Round 2). **Incomplete fix.**

## MEDIUM Severity (4)

### GREVM-R3-003: `nonce + 1` Overflow in Nonce Assertion

**File:** `grevm/src/async_commit.rs:105`

`assert_eq!(change.info.nonce, expect + 1)` — if `expect` is `u64::MAX`, `expect + 1` wraps to 0 in release mode (overflow-checks disabled). The assertion would compare against 0 instead of the intended value.

### GREVM-R3-004: Write Set Not Cleaned on EVM Error Re-execution

**File:** `grevm/src/scheduler.rs:719-739`

When a tx encounters an EVM error, the old write_set from a previous successful incarnation is preserved and stored back. The stale `mv_memory` entries remain. During re-execution, `write_new_locations` flag may be incorrectly computed, potentially skipping necessary revalidation of dependent transactions.

### GREVM-R3-005: `key_tx` Dependency Race with Concurrent `commit`

**File:** `grevm/src/tx_dependency.rs:112-123`

Race between `key_tx(txid)` and `commit(txid-1)` can cause unnecessary double-scheduling. Benign in current code but creates latent performance degradation under pathological workloads.

### GREVM-R3-006: `update_mv_memory` Coinbase Skip Hides User ETH Transfers

**File:** `grevm/src/storage.rs:208-210`

All coinbase changes are skipped in `update_mv_memory`, including **user-initiated ETH transfers** to the coinbase address. If tx A sends ETH to coinbase and tx B reads the coinbase balance, the change is invisible in MVMemory. The `accurate_origin` flag partially mitigates this but has a gap: when `commit_idx == current_tx.txid` and a preceding executed-but-uncommitted tx sent ETH to coinbase.

**Impact:** Potential stale coinbase balance reads causing incorrect execution that validation may not catch.

---

## LOW Severity (3)

### GREVM-R3-007: ERC20 Transfer Uses Slot 0, TransferFrom Uses Slot 1 for Balances

**File:** `grevm/src/hint.rs:236-253 vs 255-280`

Inconsistent storage slot assumptions between Transfer (slot 0) and TransferFrom (slot 1) for balance mappings. Performance-only impact since validation catches all conflicts.

### GREVM-R3-008: `results.push(result)` Before Error Check

**File:** `grevm/src/async_commit.rs:136-139`

The execution result is pushed to `self.results` even when the nonce check fails. The results vector contains an entry for a transaction whose state was never committed.

**Prior:** GREVM-R2-002. **Partially fixed.**

### GREVM-R3-009: `lazy_reward` Applied After Error Not Guarded at Method Entry

**File:** `grevm/src/async_commit.rs:141-151`

The `commit()` method does not check `self.commit_result` at entry. If a caller fails to check between calls, state corruption could compound. Mitigated by caller's check in `async_commit()`.

---

## INFO (2)

### GREVM-R3-010: Block-STM Validation Invariant Confirmed ✓

The Block-STM validation loop correctly detects all read-write conflicts and triggers re-execution. The OCC-based approach ensures eventual consistency even when hints are incorrect.

### GREVM-R3-011: DAG-based Scheduling Correctly Parallelizes Independent Transactions ✓

The hint-based DAG construction and partition assignment produce correct dependency ordering. Mis-hints only affect performance, not correctness, due to the validation fallback.

| GREVM-004 (TOCTOU in async_finality) | **Still exploitable** — see GREVM-R3-001 |
| GREVM-006 (CAS loop in next_validation_idx) | **Not implemented** — fix checklist incorrectly marks as done |
| GREVM-R2-001 (CommitGuard) | **Incomplete** — see GREVM-R3-002 |
| GREVM-R2-002 (Early return on nonce) | **Partially done** — results.push before error check |
| GREVM-R2-003 (empty partition guard) | **Partially done** — parallel_cnt not capped |
| All other fixes | Correctly applied |
